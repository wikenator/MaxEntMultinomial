algebra#@#On a test , the average score for the girls in the class is [M:L:N] , and the average score for the boys in the class is [M:L:N] . If the average score for the class is [M:L:N] , what fraction of the class are boys ?
algebra#@#How many distinct real roots does the following equation have ? [M:EQ]
algebra#@#At William Rice 's Marsh , there are an infinite number of magic lilypads numbered [M:L:N] , [M:L:N] , [M:L:N] , and so on . A magic lilypad lights up in a frog jumps on it while it is not lit , and turns off if a frog jumps on it while it is lit . Suppose all lilypads are initially turned off . Conor the Frog begins by hopping on the first lilypad and then continues hopping on every lilypad thereafter . Conor 's friend Bob starts hopping after Conor and begins by hopping on the second pad and continues by hopping on the fourth , sixth , eighth , and so on . Shortly after Bob , Dan hops on the third , sixth , ninth , and so on lilypads . If there is a frog for each positive number [M:VAR] that hops on every (n^(th) pad , what is the number on the (m^(th) lilypad that remains lit in the end ?
algebra#@#Ashley Ann Allen , a hapless algebra student , sees the expression [M:EX:LOG] . She mistakenly cancels the ``log ''s, to get the expression [M:EX] . Miraculously , when she plugs in values for [M:VAR] and [M:VAR] , she gets the correct answer . Assuming [M:INEQ] , find all possible ordered pairs of integers [M:VAR:COORD] satisfying the given conditions .
algebra#@#Let [M:EQ] where [M:EX] is the greatest integer less than or equal to [M:VAR] . Find [M:EX] .
algebra#@#If the roots of [M:EX] are three consecutive positive integers , then what are all possible values of [M:EX] ?
algebra#@#Find all ordered pairs of digits [M:VAR:COORD] such that the [M:L:N] digit number [M:EX] is divisible by [M:L:N] .
algebra#@#If [M:VAR] , [M:VAR] , [M:VAR] are real numbers such that [M:EQ] , [M:EQ] , [M:EQ] . Find [M:EX] .
algebra#@#A monic polynomial is one in which the coefficient of the highest order term is [M:L:N] . Find the monic polynomial [M:EX:FUNC] (with integer coefficients ) of least degree that satisfies [M:EQ:FUNC] .
