geometry#@#Farmer John is inside of an ellipse with reflective sides , given by the equation [M:EQ] , with [M:INEQ:C] . He is standing at the point [M:L:COORD] , and he shines a laser pointer in the [M:VAR] -direction. The light reflects off the ellipse and proceeds directly toward Farmer Brown , traveling a distance of [M:L:N] before reaching him . Farmer John then spins around in a circle ; where he points the laser , the light reflects off the wall and hits Farmer Brown . What is the ordered pair [M:VAR:COORD] ?
