geometry#@#Consider a square of side length [M:L:N] . Draw four lines that each connect a midpoint of a side with a corner not on that side , such that each midpoint and each corner is touched by only one line . Find the area of the region completely bounded by these lines .
geometry#@#If we pick (uniformly) a random square of area [M:L:N] with sides parallel to the [M:VAR] - and [M:VAR] -axes that lies entirely within the [M:L:N] -by -[M:L:N] square bounded by the lines [M:EQ] , [M:EQ] , [M:EQ] , [M:EQ] (the corners of the square need not have integer coordinates ), what is the probability that the point [M:EQ:COORD] lies within the square of area [M:L:N] ?
geometry#@#Equilateral triangle [M:EX] of side length [M:L:N] is drawn . Three squares external to the triangle , [M:EX] , [M:EX] , and [M:EX] , are drawn . What is the area of the smallest triangle that contains these squares ?
geometry#@#Equilateral triangle [M:EX] of side length [M:L:N] is drawn . Three squares containing the triangle , [M:EX] , [M:EX] , and [M:EX] , are drawn . What is the area of the smallest triangle that contains these squares ?
geometry#@#Let [M:EX:T] be equilateral , and let [M:VAR] , [M:VAR] , [M:VAR] be points on sides [M:EX] , [M:EX] , [M:EX] respectively , with [M:EQ] , [M:EQ:C] , [M:EQ] . Determine the measure (in degrees ) of [M:EX:A] .
