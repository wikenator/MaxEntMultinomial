geometry#@#Anne and Lisa enter a park that has two concentric circular paths joined by two radial paths , one of which is at the point where they enter . Anne goes in to the inner circle along the first radial path , around by the shorter way to the second radial path and out along it to the exit . Walking at a the same rate , Lisa goes around the outer circle to the exit , taking the shorter of the two directions around the park . They arrive at the exit at the same time . The radial paths meet at the center of the park ; what is the angle between them (in radians )?

The following construction , given in [M:L:N] by Adam Kochansky , yields a segment whose length agrees with pi to five decimal places : Construct a circle of radius [M:L:N] and call its center [M:VAR] .
