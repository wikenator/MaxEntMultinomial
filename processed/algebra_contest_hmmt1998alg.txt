algebra#@#A man named Juan has three rectangular solids , each having volume [M:L:N] . Two of the faces of one solid have areas [M:L:N] and [M:L:N] . Two faces of another solid have areas [M:L:N] and [M:L:N] . Finally , two faces of the last solid have areas [M:L:N] and [M:L:N] . What is the minimum possible exposed surface area of the tallest tower Juan can construct by stacking his solids one on top of the other , face to face ? (Assume that the base of the tower is not exposed ).

algebra#@#G. H. Hardy once went to visit Srinivasa Ramanujan in the hospital , and he started the conversation with : ``I came here in taxi -cab number [M:L:N] . That number seems dull to me , which I hope isn 't a bad omen .'' ``Nonsense,'' said Ramanujan . ``The number isn 't dull at all . It 's quite interesting . It 's the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways .'' Ramanujan had immediately seen that [M:EQ] . What is the smallest positive integer representable as the sum of the cubes of three positive integers in two different ways ?
