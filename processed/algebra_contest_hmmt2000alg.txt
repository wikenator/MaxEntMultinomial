algebra#@#How many integers [M:VAR] satisfy [M:INEQ] and [M:INEQ] ?
algebra#@#Evaluate [M:EX] .
algebra#@#Five students take a test on which any integer score from [M:L:N] to [M:L:N] inclusive is possible . What is the largest possible difference between the median and the mean of the scores ?
algebra#@#What is the fewest number of multiplications required to reach [M:EX] from [M:VAR] , using only previous generated powers of [M:VAR] ? For example , [M:EX] uses [M:L:N] multiplications .
algebra#@#A jacket was originally priced [M:L:N] . The price was reduced by [M:L:N:P] three times and incresed by [M:L:N:P] four times in some order . To the nearest cent , what was the final price ?
algebra#@#Barbara , Edward , Abhinav , and Alex took turns writing this test . Working alone , they could finish it in [M:L:N] , [M:L:N] , [M:L:N] , and [M:L:N] days , respectively . If only one person works on the test per day , and nobody works on it unless everyone else has spent at least as many days working on it , how many days (an integer ) did it take to write this test ?
algebra#@#A number [M:VAR] is called multiplicatively perfect if the product of all the positive divisors of [M:VAR] is [M:EX] . Determine the number of positive multiplicatively perfect numbers less than [M:L:N] .
algebra#@#A man has three daughters . The product of their ages is [M:L:N] , and he remembers that the sum of their ages is the number of trees in his yard . He counts the trees but cannot determine any of their ages . What are all possible ages of his oldest daughter ?
algebra#@#Find the smallest positive integer [M:VAR] such that [M:EX] is not prime for any integer [M:VAR] .
