algebra#@#If [M:EQ] , for how many real values of a does [M:EQ] ?
algebra#@#For what single digit [M:VAR] does [M:L:N] divide the [M:L:N] -digit number [M:EX] ?
algebra#@#Alex is stuck on a platform floating over an abyss at [M:L:N] ft /s. An evil physicist has arranged for the platform to fall in (taking Alex with it ) after traveling [M:L:N] ft . One minute after the platform was launched , Edward arrives with a second platform capable of floating all the way across the abyss . He calculates for [M:L:N] seconds , then launches the second platform in such a way as to maximize the time that one end of Alex 's platform is between the two ends of the new platform , thus giving Alex as much time as possible to switch . If both platforms are [M:L:N] ft long and move with constant velocity once launched , what is the speed of the second platform (in ft /s)?
algebra#@#Find all possible values of [M:EX] where [M:EX] , [M:INEQ] .
algebra#@#You are trapped in a room with only one exit , a long hallway with a series of doors and land mines . To get out you must open all the doors and disarm all the mines . In the room is a panel with [M:L:N] buttons , which conveniently contains an instruction manual . The red button arms a mine , the yellow button disarms two mines and closes a door , and the green button opens two doors . Initially [M:L:N] doors are closed and [M:L:N] mines are armed . The manual warns that attempting to disarm two mines or open two doors when only one is armed /closed will reset the system to its initial state . What is the minimum number of buttons you must push to get out ?
algebra#@#Carl and Bob can demolish a building in [M:L:N] days , Anne and Bob can do it in [M:L:N] , Anne and Carl in [M:L:N] . How many days does it take all of them working together if Carl gets injured at the end of the first day and can 't come back ? Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms .
algebra#@#If [M:EX:FUNC] is a monic quartic polynomial such that [M:EQ:FUNC] , [M:EQ:FUNC] , [M:EQ:FUNC] , and [M:EQ:FUNC] , find [M:EX:FUNC] .
algebra#@#How many ways are there to cover a [M:EX] rectangle with [M:L:N] identical dominoes ?
algebra#@#Pyramid EARLY is placed in [M:VAR:COORD] coordinates so that [M:EQ:COORD] , [M:EQ:COORD] , [M:EQ:COORD] , [M:EQ:COORD], and [M:EQ:COORD] . Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from [M:VAR:COORD] to any of the [M:L:N] points [M:VAR:COORD] , [M:VAR:COORD] , [M:VAR:COORD] , [M:VAR:COORD] . Sean starts at [M:VAR] and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid , choosing each of the possible paths with probability [M:L:F] each time . What is the probability that he ends up at the point [M:L:COORD] ?
